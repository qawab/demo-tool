### Changes for v1.8.0:
- Added an option to display /org messages.
- Added a small window on the left side that displays information about the current player / spectatee
- Proximity list now shows:
  - 1) When players are speaking
  - 2) TeamSpeak members (shown as different colour)
- Added a small fade-in and fade-out animation when players go in or out of range

### Changes for v1.7.0:
- Added a fast forward multiplier.

### Changes for v1.6.0:
- Added ignore Z (often referred to as chams). Do note, this feature is performance heavy as it has to render every player an additional time.
- Added eye trace. Do note, this feature is also not performance friendly.
- Made thirdperson whilst in vehicles properly orient around the vehicle, rather than the player.
- Made Steam/OOC name rendering optional in the options panel.
- Added an optional system which checks for a newer version upon loading the script. Due to limitations imposed by the GLua API, it is not feasible to automatically update the script.

### Changes for v1.5.0:
- Added a keybinding system, with it an additional 4 keybinds:
	- Cycle pause/resume
    - Toggle third-person
	- Toggle noclip
	- Toggle third-person mouse control (can also by toggled via M2 -> Thirdperson -> Toggle mouse control)
- Added an option to display a list of keybinds in the bottom right
- Made it easier to read ESP text by changing order of colours depending on the player's job
- Stopped that annoying ass dome from rendering

### Changes for v1.4.0:
- Made ESP render below players, which massively improves visibility.
- Added voice proximity list as an option. It shows a list of players who are able to hear the target player.
- Added "flashed", "call", and teamspeak (shortened down to "TS") to the list of possible statuses in ESP
- Added a fast-forward keybind in options. Holding the key makes demo playback twice as fast.
- Added NLR to ESP. It only shows up if a player is in their NLR zone.
- Added the player's Steam name to their RP name above their head.
- Whilst in noclip/thirdperson, you can use +left / +right to slowly move the camera.
- Made noclip speed consistent and (kind of) independent of frametime

### Changes for v1.3.0:
- Added a semi-fuzzy search panel to the spectator sub-menu (M2 -> Spectate -> Search). This has fully replaced the "Find by Steam ID" option.
